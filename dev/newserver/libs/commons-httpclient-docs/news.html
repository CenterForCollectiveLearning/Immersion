                At this point HttpClient is fully feature-complete and is just a

                All of the important new features such as the new preferences 
                architecture and exception handling framework are completely documented. 
                We strongly encourage comment and criticism of the current API so we can
                have everything worked out by the first beta release. Following this 
                release the development effort will focus on stabilizing the 3.0 API 
                and adding more documentation. Depending on on how well this release is

        <p>
         The goal of the second ALPHA release is to incorporate the feedback, polish 
         the API, and update documentation. The next ALPHA release will target the
         wider audience beyond the Apache Jakarta and Apache WS communities.

      	a number of people.  We would like to thank all of those who contributed to this

      <p>While a final 2.0 release still eludes us, we have continued to make
       good progress.  This release fixes some significant bugs that crept into RC2.
       Assuming that there are no major bugs found in this release a final release should 
       follow shortly.</p>
    </div><div class="section"><a name="13_October_2003_-_HttpClient_2_0_Release_Candidate_2_released"></a><h2>13 October 2003 - HttpClient 2.0 Release Candidate 2 released</h2>
      <p>Releasing a final version of HttpClient 2.0 by the end of Summer 2003, as 
       originally planned, was not possible. There were a significant number of minor 
       bugs reported against RC1. None of them were major, but verifying, fixing, and 
       testing simply took time more time than anticipated.  We are pleased to 
       announce the second release candidate of HttpClient 2.0 and hope to follow up 
       with a final release shortly.</p>
      <p>At the same time we have been busy working on our next release, currently 
       designated as 2.1. It it shaping up quite well. We already have a new preferences 
       architecture in place that will help us provide greater control over HttpClient 
       without polluting its API with too many options. We have also completely reworked 
       redirect/authentication/retry logic and can now support cross-host redirects, a 
       much complained about limitation of HttpClient 2.0.</p>

        was surprisingly low. We are confident that <em>HttpClient 2.0</em> has
