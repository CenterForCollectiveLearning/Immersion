      <p>This tutorial is designed to provide a basic overview of how to use
        <em>HttpClient</em>.  When you have completed the tutorial you will have written
        a simple application that downloads a page using <em>HttpClient</em>.</p>

      <p>It is assumed that you have an understanding of how to program in
      Java and are familiar with the development environment you are using.</p>
    </div><div class="section"><a name="Getting_Ready"></a><h2>Getting Ready</h2>
      <p>The first thing you need to do is get a copy of <em>HttpClient</em> and its
      <a href="dependencies.html">dependencies</a>. This tutorial was
      written for <em>HttpClient</em> 3.0.  You will also need JDK 1.3 or above.</p>

    <p>Once you've downloaded <em>HttpClient</em> and dependencies you will need to
      put them on your classpath.  There is also an optional dependency on JSSE
      which is required for HTTPS connections;  this is not required for this
      tutorial.</p>
    </div><div class="section"><a name="Concepts"></a><h2>Concepts</h2>
      <p>The general process for using <em>HttpClient</em> consists of a number of
      steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Create an instance of <code>HttpClient</code>.</li>
        <li>Create an instance of one of the methods (GetMethod in this
        case).  The URL to connect to is passed in to the the method
        constructor.</li>
        <li>Tell <code>HttpClient</code> to execute the method.</li>
        <li>Read the response.</li>
        <li>Release the connection.</li>
        <li>Deal with the response.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We'll cover how to perform each of these steps below.  Notice that we
      go through the entire process regardless of whether the server returned
      an error or not.  This is important because HTTP 1.1 allows multiple
      requests to use the same connection by simply sending the requests one
      after the other.  Obviously, if we don't read the entire response to
      the first request, the left over data will get in the way of the second
      response.  <em>HttpClient</em> tries to handle this but to avoid problems it is
      important to always release the connection.</p> Upon the connection release
      HttpClient will do its best to ensure that the connection is reusable.

      <div style="font-style: italic; border: 1px solid #888; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1px;">
        <p>
          It is important to always release the connection regardless of whether the server
          returned an error or not.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div><div class="section"><a name="Instantiating_HttpClient"></a><h2>Instantiating HttpClient</h2>
      <p>The no argument constructor for <code>HttpClient</code> provides a good set of
      defaults for most situations so that is what we'll use.</p>

      
    <div class="source"><pre>HttpClient client = new HttpClient();</pre></div>
  
    </div><div class="section"><a name="Creating_a_Method"></a><h2>Creating a Method</h2>
      <p>The various methods defined by the HTTP specification correspond to
        the various classes in <em>HttpClient</em> which implement the HttpMethod
      interface.  These classes are all found in the package
      <code>org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods</code>.</p>

      <p>We will be using the Get method which is a simple method that simply
      takes a URL and gets the document the URL points to.</p>

      
    <div class="source"><pre>HttpMethod method = new GetMethod("http://www.apache.org/");</pre></div>
  
    </div><div class="section"><a name="Execute_the_Method"></a><h2>Execute the Method</h2>
      <p>The actual execution of the method is performed by calling
      <code>executeMethod</code> on the client and passing in the method to
      execute.  Since networks connections are unreliable, we also need to deal
      with any errors that occur.</p>

      <p>There are two kinds of exceptions that could be thrown by
      executeMethod, <code>HttpException</code> and <code>IOException</code>.
      </p>
    
        <p>The other useful piece of information is the status code that is
        returned by the server.  This code is returned by executeMethod as an
        int and can be used to determine if the request was successful or not
        and can sometimes indicate that further action is required by the
        client such as providing authentication credentials.</p>

        <div class="subsection"><a name="HttpException"></a><h3>HttpException</h3>
          <p>An HttpException represents a logical error and is thrown when the request 
           cannot be sent or the response cannot be processed due to a fatal violation of 
           the HTTP specification. Usually this kind of exceptions cannot be recovered 
           from. For a detailed discussion on protocol exceptions please refer to 
           <a href="exception-handling.html#Protocol exceptions">the HttpClient exception 
           handling guide</a>. Note that HttpException actually extends IOException 
           so you can just ignore it and catch the IOException if your application does 
           not distinguish between protocol and transport errors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection"><a name="IOException"></a><h3>IOException</h3>
          <p>A plain IOException (which is not a subclass of HttpException) represents a 
           transport error and is thrown when an error occurs that is likely to be a 
           once-off I/O problem. Usually the request has a good chance of succeeding on
           a second attempt, so per default HttpClient will try to recover the request 
           automatically. For a detailed discussion on transport exceptions please refer to 
           <a href="exception-handling.html#Transport exceptions">the HttpClient exception 
           handling guide</a>.</p>
        </div>
          
        <div class="subsection"><a name="Method_recovery"></a><h3>Method recovery</h3>
        <p>Per default HttpClient will automatically attempt to recover from the not-fatal 
        errors, that is, when a plain IOException is thrown. HttpClient will retry the 
        method three times provided that the request has never been fully transmitted to 
        the target server. For a detailed discussion on HTTP method recovery please refer 
        to <a href="exception-handling.html#HTTP transport safety">the HttpClient 
        exception handling guide</a></p>

        
    <div class="source"><pre>
// set per default
client.getParams().setParameter(HttpMethodParams.RETRY_HANDLER, 
  new DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler());</pre></div>
  

        <p>Default recovery procedure can be replaced with a custom one. The number 
         of automatic retries can be increased. HttpClient can also be instructed to
         retry the method even though the request may have already been processed by 
         the server and the I/O exception has occurred while receiving the response. 
         Please exercise caution when enabling auto-retrial. Use it only if the method
         is known to be idempotent, that is, it is known to be safe to retry multiple 
         times without causing data corruption or data inconsistency.</p>
        <p>The rule of thumb is GET methods are usually safe unless known otherwise, 
         entity enclosing methods such as POST and PUT are usually unsafe unless known 
         otherwise.</p>

        
    <div class="source"><pre>
DefaultMethodRetryHandler retryhandler = new DefaultMethodRetryHandler(10, true);
client.getParams().setParameter(HttpMethodParams.RETRY_HANDLER, retryhandler);</pre></div>
  
        </div>
    </div><div class="section"><a name="Read_the_Response"></a><h2>Read the Response</h2>
      <p>It is vital that the response body is always read regardless of the
      status returned by the server.  There are three ways to do this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Call <code>method.getResponseBody()</code>.  This will return a
        byte array containing the data in the response body.</li>
        <li>Call <code>method.getResponseBodyAsString()</code>.  This will
        return a String containing the response body.  Be warned though that
        the conversion from bytes to a String is done using the default
        encoding so this method may not be portable across all platforms.</li>
        <li>Call <code>method.getResponseBodyAsStream()</code> and read the
        entire contents of the stream then call <code>stream.close()</code>.
        This method is best if it is possible for a lot of data to be received
        as it can be buffered to a file or processed as it is read.  Be sure to
        always read the entirety of the data and call close on the stream.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For this tutorial we will use <code>getResponseBody()</code> for simplicity.</p>

      
    <div class="source"><pre>byte[] responseBody = method.getResponseBody();</pre></div>
  
    </div><div class="section"><a name="Release_the_Connection"></a><h2>Release the Connection</h2>
      <p>This is a crucial step to keep things flowing.  We must tell
        <em>HttpClient</em> that we are done with the connection and that it can now be
        reused.  Without doing this <em>HttpClient</em> will wait indefinitely for a
        connection to free up so that it can be reused.</p>

      
    <div class="source"><pre>method.releaseConnection();</pre></div>
  
    </div><div class="section"><a name="Deal_with_the_Repsonse"></a><h2>Deal with the Repsonse</h2>
      <p>We've now completed our interaction with <em>HttpClient</em> and can just
      concentrate on doing what we need to do with the data.  In our case,
      we'll just print it out to the console.</p>

      <p>It's worth noting that if you were retrieving the response as a stream
      and processing it as it is read, this step would actually be combined
      with reading the connection, and when you'd finished processing all the
      data, you'd then close the input stream and release the connection.</p>

      <p>Note: We should pay attention to character encodings here instead of
      just using the system default.</p>

      
    <div class="source"><pre>System.out.println(new String(responseBody));</pre></div>
  
    </div><div class="section"><a name="Final_Source_Code"></a><h2>Final Source Code</h2>
      <p>When we put all of that together plus a little bit of glue code we get
      the program below.</p>

      
    <div class="source"><pre>
