<title>JCIFS</title>
<short>The Java CIFS Client Library</short>
<desc>
JCIFS is an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.php">Open Source</a> client library that implements the CIFS/SMB networking protocol in 100% Java. CIFS is the standard file sharing protocol on the Microsoft Windows platform (e.g. Map Network Drive ...). This client is used extensively in production on large Intranets.

<title>jcifs-1.3.17 released / SO_TIMEOUT Fixed, Connect Timeout Control Added</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, October 18, 2011</sub>
<desc>
The <code>jcifs.smb.client.soTimeout</code> property, which controls how long the client will wait to read data from a server, was broken in the previous release (1.3.16). Not only was it broken but no SO_TIMEOUT was specified at all meaning if a server became unresponive, JCIFS could hang for an uncontrollably long time. This behavior of this property has been restored.
<p/>
Additionally, a new <code>jcifs.smb.client.connTimeout</code> has been added which specifies the number of milliseconds that the client will wait to connect to a server (how long it will wait for a response to the TCP SYN). This can be very useful when trying to communicate with many servers in parallel.

<title>jcifs-1.3.16 released / SO_TIMEOUT, Disconnect Improvements, copyTo() Exceptions and more</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, June 25, 2011</sub>
<desc>
This release includes the following minor fixes and improvements:
<ul>
<li>
JCIFS now uses the InetSocketAddress class to explicitly bind and set the SO_TIMEOUT on client sockets before they are connected. This makes the SO_TIMEOUT effective when the target server socket is not listening and the client OS socket implementation takes a long time for the dropped SYN to timeout. This may significantly reduce resource consumption in applications that use multiple threads to constantly query servers that may not be listening.
</li><li>
When disconnecting a transport, new clauses have been added to better reset transport state whereas previously transports could get stuck in a disconnected state for unnecessarily long periods of time.
</li><li>
A new property jcifs.smb.client.ignoreCopyToException has been added. When set to "true" (the default), the SmbFile.copyTo() method will ignore (but log) exceptions trying to copy individual files or directories (such as because of a permissions error). To maintain backward compatibility, the default value of this property is "true" (exceptions are ignored). Setting this property to "false" will cause any exception that occurs trying to copy an individual file or directory to be thrown out of copyTo and abort the copy operation at the point of failure. 
</li><li>
If an authentication exception occurs trying to connect to a server that has multiple IP addresses, JCIFS will not attempt to connect to more than one IP addresses because doing so could result in an account lockout.
</li><li>
The SID resolver code incorrectly resolved SIDs of an ACE in blocks of at most 10 where it should have used a limit of 64. This performance issue has been fixed.
</li><li>
JCIFS will not throw the artifical "Access is denied" error if the special NtlmPasswordCredential.ANONYMOUS credential is used explicitly (whereas normally JCIFS will deliberately throw an SmbAuthException if a login results in a guest login or if the anonymous identity is used).
</li><li>
The NetrServerEnum2 RAP call used incorrect parameter descriptiors which could result in "SmbException: 2320" errors trying to list domains and servers from the local NetBIOS browse service.
</li><li>
The NTLMSSP AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE (aka "Type 2 Message") encoding routine incorrectly left out the TargetName field (although this had no effect on CIFS client behavior).
</li>
</ul>

<title>jcifs-1.3.14 released / NetBIOS Node Status Disabled and Named Pipe Errors</title>

<desc>
JCIFS will no longer do a NetBIOS Node Status to determine the server hostname because it seems some servers no longer respond to it. Under high load "All pipe instances are busy" errors could occur. This has been fixed by adding a lock to ensure that the MSRPC bind and pipe open request are performed together.

Locking throughout the transport layer has been rewritten. This should fix the long standing deadlock that has been reported in the past. Note that these are significant changes to the I/O layer. The package should be tested carefully before being deployed.
<p/>The size of the transient input buffer used to read the SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE response has been doubled to accommodate a security blob (as observed with OSX Snow Leopard). A signing issue reading data from an EMC server has been fixed. NTLMSSP logging has been improved.

<title>JCIFS U.S. Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCN)</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, August 27, 2009</sub>
<desc>
JCIFS uses cryptography including RC4 128 (for NTLMv2) and AES 256 (for Kerberos) for authentication, digital signatures and encryption.
Products that use cryptography and which are exported from the U.S. to other countries are supposed to obtain an export classification.
The United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has issued two ECCNs for the JCIFS package:
<blockquote>
5D002.C.1 License Exception TSU<br/>
5D992.C (for binary only distribution of "mass market" software)
</blockquote>
For commercial products that ship JCIFS in binary form, you will need to reference the second ECCN in your export classification requests.
For further information such as CCATS numbers, please contact ioplex<i style="font-style: normal;">@</i>gmail.com.
<p/>
The JCIFS Team would like to thank BIS for their excellent service and patience.

<title>jcifs-1.3.3 released / NTLMv2 Requirements, "Invalid parameter" Error, and NetBIOS Broadcast Lookup Timeouts</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, Jan 25, 2009</sub>
<desc>
NTLMv2 support requires the RC4 cipher. Note that Sun's Java did not include RC4 until Java 1.5 update 7.
<p/>
If the above mentioned RC4 cipher was not available, an "Invalid parameter" error would occur. Logic has been corrected so that the more informative "Cannot find any provider supporting RC4" error is reported instead.
<p/>
To date, JCIFS has always tried NetBIOS broadcast lookups in favor of DNS which frequently resulted in a 6 second delay if the <tt>jcifs.resolveOrder</tt> property was not adjusted. This behavior has been changed to try DNS before NetBIOS broadcast lookups which should result in much less frequent delays when using default settings. To restore the old behavior, simply set <tt>jcifs.resolveOrder=LMHOSTS,BCAST,DNS</tt>.
<p/>
The NTLMSSP code would not fallback to ASCII if Cp850 was not available (which is the case with stock JREs). This issue has been fixed.

Accessing a DFS link on Samba directly could result in an error. This issue has been fixed. Samba 3.0.x does not support raw NTLMSSP and therefore the new default JCIFS settings that use NTLMSSP break JCIFS and Samba 3.0.x compatibility. To work-around, turn off extended security and use NTLMv1 by setting <tt>jcifs.smb.client.useExtendedSecurity=false</tt> and <tt>jcifs.smb.lmCompatibility=0</tt>.

The NTLM HTTP Filter was broken in 1.3.0. Setting jcifs.smb.client.useExtendedSecurity to false fixes the issue. This property has been changed in the Filter init method. Some minor DFS changes have been applied that users claim prevent issues in certain DFS scenarios. The NTLMv2 code has been refined in several ways (in particular the getNTLMv2Response method has changed). The NtlmPasswordAuthentication constructor will now split the username if it appears to be composed of a domain and username.

<title>jcifs-1.3.0 released / NTLMv2 Support</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, Oct 25, 2008</sub>
<desc>
NTLMv2 has been fully implemented and will be used by default.
<p/>
To emulate the old behavior you must set <tt>jcifs.lmCompatibility = 0</tt> and <tt>jcifs.smb.client.useExtendedSecurity = false</tt> (new defaults are <tt>3</tt> and <tt>true</tt> respectively).
<p/>
NTLMv2 and NTLMv1 over NTLMSSP has been fairly well tested with and without SMB signing negotiated and various NTLMSSP flags (e.g. <tt>NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE_NTLM2</tt>).
<p/>
Note: The NTLM HTTP Filter does not and can never support NTLMv2 as it uses a main-in-the-middle technique that is broken by NTLMSSP's "target information" used in computing password hashes. However, the existing Filter should continue to work.

The SmbFileInputStream methods will now throw InterruptedIOExceptions where apppropriate whereas previously they would throw SmbExceptions with a root cause of TransportException with a root cause of InterruptedException.

If SmbSession.send() threw an exception it could trigger "Invalid parameter" exceptions on subsequent requests.
<p/>
An InterruptedException in the NameServiceClient was being caught and ignored. It will now be re-thrown as an IOException so that all threads used with/by JCIFS can be triggered to return immediately.
<p/>
A jcifs.smb.client.dfs.disabled property has been added to disable domain based DFS so that JCIFS can be configured not to try and fail to resolve paths as domain paths in non-domain environments (e.g. on the local machine).
<p/>
The getSecurity and getShareSecurity methods will now return null if no DACL is present on a file whereas previously it would return an empty array. This allows the caller to distinguish between an object that has a DACL with no elements and one that has no DACL at all.

This release includes a few significant fixes for DCERPC related issues. It also includes numerous minor fixes for issues that have accumulated over time. The issues that have been fixed are as follows:

<ul>
<li>
The SID.getServerSid() method could fail with NetApp servers due to a "generic" mask values. The mask has been changed to 0x00000001 which corresponds to an LsaOpenPolicy mask of POLICY_VIEW_LOCAL_INFORMATION.
</li><li>
The LsaPolicyHandle class would not throw an error if the LsarOpenPolicy2 call failed. This has been fixed.
</li><li>
If a share was unshared while JCIFS was in the middle of reading files from it, the transport could enter an error state from which it could not immediately recover if the share was subsequently restored. A small change to SmbTransport.doRecv() fixes this problem.
</li><li>
The SmbFile constructor could inappropriately URL decode the authority component of SMB URLs.
</li><li>
The NTLM HTTP Filter documentation has been updated.
</li><li>
An Invalid state: 4 error has been fixed.

<title>jcifs-1.2.16 released / Domain-Based DFS Support</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, Aug 2, 2007</sub>
<desc>
With this release, JCIFS now supports domain-based DFS. With domain-based DFS, clients access DFS roots under the DNS domain name like \\example.com\dfs\foo so that users do not need to remember server names. However, for clients to work with these DFS roots they have to be prepared to connect to each domain controller as necessary to find the target share and successfully authenticate. JCIFS now includes this retry logic. JCIFS will also do something that it seems even Windows clients do not do - if you list the shares of a domain (e.g. <tt>(new SmbFile("smb://example.com/")).listFiles()</tt>), JCIFS will build a merged list of all shares on all domain controllers.
<p/>
Note that these changes are fairly significant. Whenever JCIFS tries to connect to a server this new logic is used. So if anyone notices anything out of the ordinary please report it to the JCIFS mailing list.

<ul>
<li>An SMB signing failure related to DFS that could result in "Access denied" errors has been fixed.</li>
<li>The DCERPC bind did not exactly mimic Windows which uses SMB_COM_{WRITE,READ}_ANDX. We were using TransactNmPipe throughout which could result in an 'Incorrect function' error when querying the LSA on a NetApp server. JCIFS now implements the bind exactly like Windows to help ensure compatibility with other servers.</li>
<li>Other changes related to NetApp compatibility include falling back to SamrConnect2 if a DCERPC_FAULT_OP_RNG_ERROR error occurs, more closely mimicking the SMB_COM_NT_CREATE_ANDX "extended" response, adjusting various RPC handle operation access masks, uncommenting some padding code that was commented out for what appeared to be a NetWare problem, disabling some logic to use port 139 if the jcifs.netbios.hostname was set and finally adding code to include LsarQosInfo structures in the MSRPC bind.</li>
<li>Some new error code information has been added.</li>
<li>Constants for common SIDs have been added to the SID class.</li>
<li>The SID.getGroupMemberSids() method will now return an empty SID array if the SID is not of type SID_TYPE_DOM_GRP or SID_TYPE_ALIAS.</li>

The <tt>getSecurity()</tt> method did not work over DFS. A very small but potentially significant change has been made to the DFS code. I do not have a sophisticated DFS test environment so please pay special attention to JCIFS with DFS and report any problems to the JCIFS mailing list.
<p/>
The <tt>toString()</tt> method of the SID class has been changed back to the old behavior of returning only the numeric SID representation. This was done not only for backward compatibility with previous versions of JCIFS but because conceptually the textual representation of a SID is not it's resolved account name. A new <tt>toDisplayString</tt> method has been added to return the resolved Windows ACL editor text (as <tt>toString()</tt> did in the 1.2.11 release). The <tt>toSidString()</tt> method has been removed. The <tt>getDomainName()</tt> and <tt>getAccountName()</tt> methods have not changed.

<title>jcifs-1.2.10b released / MSRPC Support, Long Unicode Share Name Enumeration and Critical Bugfixes</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, Nov 13, 2006</sub>
<desc>
This release contains the following new functionality and fixes:
<ul>
<li>Long Unicode Share Enumeration - The SmbFile.list* methods will now try to use MSRPC to enumerate shares if the target is a server. If the operation should fail for any reason, the client will fall back to trying the older RAP method. This should permit enumerating shares with names that use charsets other than the negotiated OEM "ASCII" encoding, share names that are longer than 12 characters, and arbirarily large lists of shares.</li>
<li>MSRPC Support - MSRPC support has been integrated into JCIFS directly. It should now be possible to add new RPCs (AT jobs, SID/group name resolution, service management, regedit, etc) relatively easily with little knowledge of MSRPC protocols. Look at the jcifs/dcerpc/msrpc/MsrpcShareEnum.java class for an example and ask the mailing list for further instructions.</li>
<li>Apr 24 bugfix - A NullPointerException caused by an error in logic has been fixed.</li>
<li>May 10 bugfix - The client will now detect if the JRE supports Cp850 and set the default jcifs.encoding to US-ASCII if it does not. This will eliminate some NullPointerExceptions that were occuring as a result.</li>
<li>A small update about keep-alives has been added to the NTLM HTTP Authentication document.</li>
<li>Jun 21 bugfix - CLOSE-WAIT sockets left over by read errors have been fixed.</li>
<li>Jul 19 bugfix - Errors caused by using UnicodeLittle as opposed to UnicodeLittleUnmarked have been fixed by ensuring UnicodeLittleUnmarked is used throughout the codebase.</li>
<li>Oct 3 bugfix - Invalid state errors from Transport classes have been fixed. It should be safe to interrupt() JCIFS operations now.</li>
<li>Oct 20 bugfix - Uncontrolled looping due to invalid Transport logic has been fixed.</li>
<li>Oct 25 bugfix - Logic has been added to make domain controller lookups more robust.</li>
<li>Oct 27 bugfix - Failure when using SmbFile.renameTo() with jcifs.smb.client.ssnLimit=1 has been fixed.</li>
<li>Oct 31 bugfix - Endless looping when all WINS servers in a list are unavailable has been fixed.</li>

<title>jcifs-krb5-1.2.9 released / Kerberos Authentication Support</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, Sep 13, 2006</sub>
<desc>
This package is stock jcifs-1.2.9 modified to support Kerberos 5 / SPNEGO extended security authentication. Please note that this has no impact on the HTTP Filter which still only supports NTLM.
<p/>
The <tt>examples/KerberosAuthExample.java</tt> is included to demonstrate using this package however note that this example initializes a logon context from a username and password. In the steady-state it is more likely that the user will already have a credential (e.g. via kinit) in which case your application code would be different. You will need to familiarize yourself with JGSS and it's <tt>Krb5LogonModule</tt> to fully utilitize this new feature.
<p/>
WARNING: This package has been reported to work by several users however the code has not been examined carefully by jCIFS maintainers and therefore should be considered highly experimental.
<p/>
Note: This package has been compiled with Java 1.5. It may work with eariler versions of Java but you will need to recompile and experiment to determine what the precise requirements are.
<p/>
Great thanks to Mr. Shun from Japan for contributing this work. Ever notice Japan always get's new stuff first?

<title>jcifs-1.2.4 released / Timedout Waiting for Response Exception, Bogus Signature Error, and More</title>

<desc>
A NetBIOS keep-alive message (received after ~10 minutes) would break message processesing with a <i>timedout waiting for response</i> Exception. This has been fixed.
<p/>
JCIFS would fail to validate responses with a status that is not zero. Assuming we are calculating the verfication signature correctly I can only assume the affected servers choose not to generate the correct signature for error responses (perhaps for DOS reasons). Because JCIFS checked the signature before the message status, an error response would fail with "signature verification failure". This behavior has been changed so that signatures are not verified if the status is non zero.
<p/>
It was discovered that the new transport (as of 1.2.x) could not cleanly recover from temporary server failure (e.g. a restart). This has been fixed. Methods will still throw Exceptions but the moment the server comes back online the client should gracefully recover.

<title>jcifs-1.2.0 released / New Transport Layer, Port 445, getDiskFreeSpace</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, May 22, 2005</sub>
<desc>
The transport layer (the code that multiplexes requests from muliple threads over sockets) has occasionally caused trouble over the years. In general it was too complex. To remedy this problem the transport was rewritten and a forked 1.1.19 was released as the "trans" branch. This branch appears to be at stable enough that it is being released as 1.2.
<p/>
The biggest change in this release should not be visible to users (hopefully) although some new features have managed to sneak in as a result of this merger. These new features are:
<ul>
<li>The client will now attempt to connect to port 445 as opposed to port 139. If this connection fails the client will fall-back to port 139.</li>
<li>If a share was disabled while jCIFS was connected an error would occur even if the share was reenabled before the client tried to access it. This has been fixed so that the client will reconnect and complete the current operation transparently.</li>
<li>The getDiskFreeSpace() method could report the wrong value for very large volumes. This has been fixed by adding a new info-level.</li>
<li>Named pipes were broken by changes for DCE/RPC transactions. They have been repaired.</li>
<li>The NetBIOS name resolution code will now use the <i>last</i> resource record in a name query response rather than the first. This appears to be more correct (at least with WMWare adapters on my XP workstation).</li>
<li>The client is generally faster because the transport is simpler. The amount of code for the transport is less than half of what it used to be.</li>

<sub>posted by Mike, Oct 1, 2004</sub>

There have been significant changes that should improve the reliability and overall behavior of JCIFS particularly for users of the <tt>NtlmHttpFilter</tt>.
<ul>
<li>NbtAddress.get<b>All</b>ByName - The <tt>NbtAddress.getAllByName()</tt> method has been implemented that will return all RDATA records for a NetBIOS name. Thus, you can now retrieve the full list of domain controllers with <tt>NbtAddress.getByName( "MYDOM", 0x1C, null, null )</tt>. The old behavior of returning a random entry from the <tt>getByName</tt> method has been eliminated.</li>
<li>SYN Timeout - The socket code has been modified to employ the transport thread when opening a new connection. This eliminates the annoying 1min+ hang that occurs trying to connect to a non-existant but routable addresss (i.e. the single threaded <tt>SmbCrawler</tt> example is relatively fast now).</li>
<li>SmbSession.getChallengeForDomain - A new method has been added to retrieve an object that encapsulates both the server session key (a.k.a. challenge) and the <tt>UniAddress</tt> from which it came. This method is used solely by the NTLM HTTP Authentication Filter to eliminate the possibility for a different domain controller to be queried in the middle of client nogotiation. Prior to this release this could result in temporary authentication failures. This code uses the new <tt>getAllByName</tt> method to build a list of domain controllers suitable for authenticating web clients. The clent will rotate evenly through the list and remove entries that are unresponsive. This makes the filter very resilent to domain controller failures.</li>
<li>Session Expiration - because of the above changes the client will now proactively close idle sessions. This is particularly pertainent to the NTLM HTTP Filter which really only touches the session when it is first created as the resulting credentials are cached in the user's HTTP session.</li>
<li>Read Bug - A read bug in JCIFS that affected EMC Celera servers has been fixed.</li>
<li>NetBIOS CalledName - The <tt>firstCalledName/nextCalledName</tt> methods have been modified to try <tt>SMBSERVER*</tt> first and fall back to other names. This should eliminate a round trip during session establishment in newer environments.</li>
</ul>
Finally, I have updated the sample <a href="view-source:http://jcifs.samba.org/src/examples/web.xml">web.xml</a>. It should be used as a stationary in all production environments.

<title>jcifs-1.0.0 released / 5 Years and Beyond</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, Sep 6, 2004</sub>
<desc>
According to the <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/jcifs/">freshmeat page</a>, JCIFS is 5 years old today (vote for us!). The project has come a long way in those years. Its features now include:
<ul>
<li>
The <a href="src/docs/ntlmhttpauth.html">NTLM HTTP Authentication Filter</a>, which adds easy Single Sign On (SSO) functionality to Java Servlet containers, is clearly the most popular feature of JCIFS. Eric did a great job of deciphering the details of <a href="http://davenport.sourceforge.net/ntlm.html">that protocol</a>. The filter is mind-numbingly easy to install as all it requires is the JCIFS jar and a filter section in your <a href="view-source:http://jcifs.samba.org/src/examples/web.xml">web.xml</a> with two or three init parameters [1].
</li><li>
The performance of JCIFS is one of its more surprising achievements. Consider the client can enumerate 5GB of files and directories in less than 10 seconds [2]. To reduce memory usage and increase concurrency JCIFS automatically reuses existing transports and sessions. One nice artifact of this design is that the NTLM HTTP Authentication Filter scales to thousands of active clients. And because the negotiated credentials are cached in the user's HTTP session the number of concurrent user's supported can be many times greater than that.
</li><li>
The <a href="src/docs/api/jcifs/smb/SmbFile.html#copyTo(jcifs.smb.SmbFile)">SmbFile.copyTo()</a> method is a venerable feature in itself. All file and directory attributes and timestamps are mirrored perfectly [3]. It employs an extra thread to write data while the next read operation is in progress. This optimization makes JCIFS the fastest client available for copying large trees of files and directories across hosts (neither of which needs to be the local machine).
</li><li>
Accessing DFS volumes (sub-trees of files and directories that actually reside on another host) is fully transparent to the user. The client may be redirected multiple times in the middle of any operation. After a redirection has occurred the mapping is cached but the cache is only queried for transports that indicate they host DFS volumes.
</li><li>
SMB signing is robust and negotiated automatically with servers that require it.
</li><li>
The <a href="src/docs/api/jcifs/smb/SmbRandomAccessFile.html">SmbRandomAccessFile</a> implementation is a complete drop in replacement for the standard java.io.RandomAccessFile. When opened with SmbFile.FILE_NO_SHARE share access this class is a legitimate database API.
</li><li>
Named Pipes of all types are fully supported. TransactNamedPipe, CallNamedPipe, and standard file I/O style pipes are all supported using a <a href="http://jcifs.samba.org/src/docs/pipes.html">single generic API</a> that conforms to the InputStream/OutputStream model.
</li><li>
JCIFS' <a href="src/docs/resolver.html">name resolution capability</a> is very sophisticated. WINS, DNS, NetBIOS broadcast queries, and remote lmhosts files are supported well. Which services and the order in which each service is queried is fully configurable. The name service cache policy is also adjustable.
</li><li>
JCIFS implements the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-crhertel-smb-url-07.txt">SMB URL Draft Specification V07</a> and processes all SMB URLs through an SMB URL proticol handler. This same handler is used to build standard java.net.URL objects which means once the protocol handler is registered SMB URLs can be used with any application that uses URLs (e.g. -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=smb://mymachine/c/download/myapp.jar).
</li>
</ul>
Other features include NTLM and LMv2 Authentication [4], optimal request batching, <a href="ntstatus.txt">NT STATUS codes</a>, full transactions, large file support, Unicode support from the ground up [5], NTLM HTTP <a href="src/docs/httpclient.html">authentication wrappers for HTTP and HTTPS clients</a>, a simple logging facility, and extensive documentation. If that's not enough, there's always <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcifs-ext/">jcifs-ext</a> where bleeding edge JCIFS extensions live.
<p/>
But the best feature of JCIFS is the simplicity of <a href="src/docs/api/">the API</a> itself. We have diligently resisted "feature creep". The SMB URL allows addressing resources with wonderful ease. The SmbFile class is a drop in replacement for java.io.File so if you know how to use that, you know how to use JCIFS.
<p/>
JCIFS is now one of the most sophisticated and powerful CIFS clients available free or otherwise. It is used in production environments by many large commercial organizations and the Open Source model has worked well for us as these users have contibuted valuable feekback that has made JCIFS rock solid.
<p/>
To commemorate these achievements we are proud to release JCIFS 1.0. Aside from fixing broken links and a few packaging tweaks it is not different from 0.9.8 and we hope it stays that way. Moving forward, the 1.0 branch will only receive critical fixes.
<p/>
In recent weeks a MIDL compatible IDL compiler was developed. Coupled with the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jarapac/">Jarapac DCE/RPC framework</a> for Java it is now practical to make <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/rpc/rpc/overviews.asp">MSRPC</a> calls. This means that the Microsoft network management API functions are very close to being incorporated into JCIFS. IDL files need to be written and APIs need to be devised but we will soon be able to create users, edit groups, control NT services, reboot machines, edit the registry, execute programs on a remote host, and much much more. This will open up an entirely new level of integration between Java and Microsoft environments.
<p/>
Finally, thanks goes out to Eric and Chris and everyone else that has contributed their time. JCIFS is truely a great product because we have taken full advantage of the Open Source model. We would not have made nearly as much progress without the code, bug fixes, problem reports, and solutions provided by our users.

<sub>posted by Mike, Sep 3, 2004</sub>
<desc>
If the "guest" account on a server was not disabled as it normally is it would be possible for a user to use an invalid username to access an SMB resource or website protected with the NtlmHttpFilter. JCIFS will no longer successfully authenticate the "guest" account at all (even if the guest account is enabled and the user enters "guest"). A log message will now be generated for all SmbAuthExceptions in the NtlmHttpFilter if the <tt>jcifs.util.loglevel</tt> property is set to 2 or greater. Behavior regarding accessing System properties has been curbed to accomodate more restrictive environments. Finally a benign exception that could occur if the client was misconfigured has been fixed.

After several weeks of hard work on our MIDL compatible IDL compiler, MS-RPC calls are now working with the Jarapac DCE framework. Currently only the ncacn_np transport in Jarapac works but other transports (e.g. TCP port 135) should work without too much trouble. The process is very easy now -- write IDL, compile with idlc, write Jarapac driver program, and go. The Jarapac examples directory has the beginnings of lsarpc, samr, and srvsvc interfaces. This should unlock a whole new set of functionality for integrating Java into Windows networks. Eat your heart out Microsoft!

<sub>posted by Mike, May 14, 2004</sub>
<desc>
And thus begins the 0.9 series. This should solidify fairly quickly although there have been some pervasive changes. The details are as follows:
<ul>
<li>PropertiesTree has been removed. Thus properties must now be specified using the full name only.</li>
<li>Multiple WINS servers may now be specified using a comma separated list of IPs (i.e. <tt>jcifs.netbios.wins=192.168.2.10,172.21.1.1,10.44.55.66</tt>).</li>
<li>The <tt>NtlmHttpFilter</tt> has been modified to support "preauthentication" such that if the <tt>jcifs.smb.client.{domain,username,password}</tt> properties are supplied as init parameters, all transports will be initialized with these credentials. This is the ideal setup for domain controllers that require SMB signatures (although it has been observed that NT 4.0 at least does not check the signatures of authentication requests).</li>
<li>NT status codes are now used in favor or DOS error codes even if DOS error codes are negotiated (mapped to NT status codes immediately after being decoded). You can <a href="ntstatus.txt">lookup NT status codes here</a>. The package used to generate this file and the jCIFS code tables is in the download area.</li>
<li>The <tt>NetServerEnum3</tt> operation has been added (thanks Gary) such that large lists of workgroups and servers may now be enumerated (doesn't help with large numbers of shares).</li>
<li>Fixed some incorrect path handling in the DFS referral code.</li>
<li>It is now NOT possible for a session setup to be transmitted if the <tt>NtlmPasswordAuthentication</tt> object's hashes were created with a server challenge that does not match the current <tt>encryptionKey</tt> of the transport. If this condition occurs and <tt>SmbAuthException</tt> with an NT status of <tt>NT_STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION</tt> will be thrown. The NTLM HTTP Filter and NetworkExplorer servlet have both been modified to catch this exception and issue an HTTP redirect to the original URL to reinitiate the NTLM negotiation.</li>
<li>The <tt>jcifs.smb.client.ssnLimit</tt> property will now open redundant transports if the limit is reached. The old behavior of closing 10% of the oldest sessions has been eliminated.</li>
<li>Several SMB signing fixes. The SMB signature code has been mostly moved into the <tt>SigningDigest</tt> class.</li>
<li>Additional checks in the initial connection code have been added to reduce/eliminate lingering <tt>CLOSE_WAIT</tt> sockets.</li>
<li>If <tt>PIPE_TYPE_TRANSACT</tt> and <tt>PIPE_TYPE_CALL</tt> are <i>not</i> specified a <tt>TRANS_WAIT_NAMED_PIPE</tt> will be issued before the open call to emulate <tt>WaitNamedPipe</tt> followed by <tt>CreateFile</tt> behavior.</li>
<li>All access specifiers have been reviewed and changed to private, static, final, etc wherever appropriate.</li>
<li>The queue used to manage MIDs has been removed in favor of something considerably simplier. Performance should be improved.</li>
<li>The NetBIOS socket OutputStream has been simplified to remove a potential copy of data. Performance should be improved.</li>
<li>The NBT header length is now checked after decoding an SMB to detect and skip incorrect byte counts. This should bypass the OS/400 bug reported.</li>
<li>Property defaults for <tt>jcifs.smb.client.listCount</tt> and <tt>jcifs.smb.client.listSize</tt> have changed from 15 to 200 and from 1200 to 65535 repspectively. High latency networks should set these values back to the old values.</li>
</ul>
Bare in mind the documentation has not been updated. That's next.

"There are also GroupUtilities, ServerUtilities, ShareUtilities, and 
UserUtilities classes which provide simplified versions of the primary

Most of the group-related stuff needs to be run against a DC, as it only

results may vary.  But I figured you might like to play with it; it's

<title>jcifs-0.8.0b released / Lots of New Features</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, Nov 24, 2003</sub>
<desc>
This  is  the  first  beta  release  of  the  0.8  series.  There have been
significant  additions  to  this  package. The most noteable is Distributed
FileSystem  (DFS)  support. This client fully supports DFS with deep paths,
multiple  redirects,  you  name  it.  This functionality required pervasive
changes so DFS users should proceed with caution and report any problems to
the  mailing list. Support for setting file attributes has been added as is
the long awaited RandomAccessFile. 
<p/>
Here is a more specific breakdown:
<ul>
<li> DFS  -  DFS  support  is  thorough.  All  DFS  operations  are completely
transparent.  It  Just  Works.  The  client can be redirected an infinate
number  of  times.  It  will reuse mappings established by other callers.
Components of a path that do not fall within the DFS space and deep paths
are  handled  properly. Also, note the new <tt>getDfsPath</tt> method can
be  used  to  determine  if a file or directory falls within a DFS space.
This  support  required pervasive changes so proceed with caution and run
your  unit  tests  with  files  that  span DFS volumes. Please report any
problems to the jCIFS mailing list.
</li>
<li> Random  Access  Files  -  The <a href="src/docs/api/jcifs/smb/SmbRandomAccessFile.html"><tt>SmbRandomAccessFile</tt></a> class has been
added.  All  features  of the analygous <tt>java.io.RandomAccessFile</tt>
class  are supported and should function as a drop in replacement. Notice
it   is   now   possible   to   set   the   size   of  a  file  with  the
<tt>SmbRandomAccessFile.setLength()</tt>    method.    Also   check   out
<tt>SmbTableFile.java</tt>   in   the  examples  directory  for  a  nifty
persistant  storage  class. When used with <tt>SmbFile.FILE_NO_SHARE</tt>
this might serve as a reasonable poor man's database. 
</li>
<li> File    Filters    -    Support    for   <tt>SmbFilenameFilter</tt>   and
<tt>SmbFileFilter</tt>  is  complete.  Because  CIFS  servers  can accept
attributes  and a wildcard expression for filtering entries on the server
side,  a  <a href="src/docs/api/jcifs/smb/DosFileFilter.html"><tt>DosFileFilter</tt></a>  is  provided  that  will  accept  these
parameters  and  pass  them to the server. The <tt>DosFileFilter</tt> can
also  be  extended  to  create  highly  sophisticated  and efficient file
filters.  Because of this work the <tt>list()</tt> and <tt>listFiles</tt>
methods have been refactored and actually reduced in size.
</li>
<li> Complete copyTo - The <tt>SmbFile.copyTo</tt> operation will now copy all
file  attributes  as  well  as  create  and last write times. Directories
copied  using  this  method should be indistinquishable from the original
minus  ACLs.  This  method  can now copy entire shares whereas previously
only sud-directories could be specified.
</li>
<li> Setting Attributes and Times - It is now possible to set file attribites,
the  create  time,  and  last  write  time  in a variety of ways. The new
methods     are     <tt>setCreateTime</tt>,     <tt>setLastModified</tt>,
<tt>getAttributes</tt>, <tt>setAttributes</tt>, <tt>setReadOnly</tt>, and
<tt>setReadWrite</tt>.
</li>
<li> Complete   Delete   -   The  <tt>SmbFile.delete()</tt>  method  will  now
completely  delete  directories  regardless  of wheather or not there are
read-only files in them.
</li>
<li> The createNewFile Method - An <tt>SmbFile.createFile</tt> method has been
added. 
</li>
</ul>

each  0x1C  domain controller query. The range of servers is limited to the
top  <tt>jcifs.netbios.lookupRespLimit</tt>  entries  in  the  NetBIOS response. The
effect  that this will have is that the <tt>NtlmHttpFilter</tt> and <tt>NtlmServlet</tt> will
rotate  through  domain  controllers when authenticating WWW clients. Also,
because  different  transports are used, fewer sessions will be multiplexed
over  each  resulting  in  an  increase  in scalability proportional to the
number  of  domain  controllers  used.  This  behavior can be turned off by
setting the <tt>jcifs.http.loadBalance</tt> property to false (the default is true).

<title>jcifs-0.7.13 released / SMB Signing Support</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, Sep 17, 2003</sub>

JCIFS  now  supports SMB signing. If a server requires SMB signing (Windows
2003  requires  it  by  default)  or if the server supports signing and the
<tt>jcifs.smb.client.signingPreferred</tt> property   is   true  signing  will  be
negotiated  and  used.  Signing does not work with NTLM HTTP authentication
because  the  original  password  hashes  are  required to generate the MAC
signing  key.  There  have  also been some adjustments to <tt>SmbFile.hashCode()</tt>.

<title>jcifs-0.7.12 released / ERRSVR/90 Fix</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, Sep 1, 2003</sub>

CIFS  permits  multiple  users  to  be  logged  in  over the same transport
(socket).  JCIFS  takes  advantage  of  this and reuses existing transports
wherever  possible.  It  was  reported  that  a user using the NTLM Servlet
Filter  was  getting  <tt>ERRSRV/90</tt>  which  means "Too many Uids active on this
session". So it looks like the limit is ~150 sessions per transport. I have
added    code    to    logoff    1/10th    of    the    sessions   if   the
jcifs.smb.client.ssnLimit propery is exceeded (default 100). <i>update: this value was later reported to be low and has been increased to 250.</i>

<desc>
A  deadlock  was  identified  in <tt>SmbTransport.java</tt> very similar to the last one found
about a year ago.  A simple but significant  change  has  been made that greatly simplifies
synchronization in the transport layer. It eliminates this issue as well as 
the  extra synchronization introduced to fix the previous problem. It is an
elemental change however so proceed with caution (<i>Update Jun 1: Reports are good; no problems</i>).
<p/>
Two  new  packages  have  been  introduced.  The  <tt>jcifs.ntlmssp</tt> package now
contains some NTLMSSP base classes. This code is used by the <tt>NtlmHttpFilter</tt> as
well  as  the  new  <tt>NtlmHttpURLConnection</tt> class for transparently enabling
your  HTTP and HTTPS client to negotiate NTLM authentication with IIS, the jCIFS Filter, Sqiud proxy, etc.
The other new
package  is  <tt>jcifs.https</tt>  which  just  contains  the HTTPS protocol handler 
necesary for proper protocol handler registration.
Please read the document entitled <a href="src/docs/httpclient.html">Using JCIFS NTLM Authentication for HTTP Connections</a> for important information about this new functionality.
<p/>
Some open flags internal to <tt>SmbFileOutputStream</tt> have been changed to permit <a href="http://lists.samba.org/pipermail/jcifs/2003-May/002168.html">unusual named pipe modes</a> to be used that previously were not considered.
<p/>
Previously it was possible for jCIFS to report incorrect (old)
file size and modification time values after writing to the file. The attribute expiration period is now reset in <tt>SmbFileOutputStream.write()</tt> to prevent this problem. It is also possible to work around the problem by setting <tt>jcifs.smb.client.attrExpirationPeriod = 0</tt> although doing so may impact performace.
<p/>
Previously using the <tt>SmbFileInputStream.skip()</tt> method meant data would be read and then discarded.
This implementation of this  method  has  been changed so that data is not read; there will be no IO to the server.
This might be useful to applications that wish to resume a large download from a certain offset within a file in the event of a network failure.

This release of the jCIFS client includes new functionality specifically targeting Web applications
as well as some critical SMB URL fixes and feature improvements. They are outlined in greater detail below. Enjoy!

<UL>
<LI> The new <tt>jcifs.http</tt> package is very handy when building
Web applications that need to integrate with MS corporate intranets. Adding
a hyperlink to a document on a network drive is easy with Network
Explorer (pictured right) and will transparently negotiate credentials
with MSIE to browse SMB resources (really, no password dialog necessary). This package also boasts an <A
HREF="src/docs/ntlmhttpauth.html">NTLM HTTP Authentication</A> servlet Filter
for authenticating MSIE clients. These are useful features because many of
the tasks surrounding user management now fall back to computer support
and HR. It is not necessary to add and remove users as they join and
leave the company. Perhaps most important from the user's perspective;
they do not need to enter a username or password if their workstation
is a member of an NT domain. The password hashes generated when they
logged on to their workstation will be negotiated during the initial
request for a session, passed through jCIFS, and validated against a
PDC or BDC. This also makes the user's domain, username, and password
available for managing session information, profiles, preferences, etc.
</LI>
<LI> The functionality used to authenticate and manage
arbitrary credentials has been exposed in the <a href="src/docs/api/jcifs/smb/SmbSession.html">SmbSession</a> and <a
href="src/docs/api/jcifs/smb/NtlmPasswordAuthentication.html">NtlmPasswordAuthentication</a>
classes. This permits NTLM password authentication to be integrated
into applications without requiring Microsoft components or JNI.
</LI>
<LI> With the introduction of the <A HREF="src/docs/api/overview-summary.html#scp"><tt>jcifs.encoding</tt></A> property the client is now truly internationalized. It has been used successfully on OS/390 with native
EBCDIC character encoding. See the Sun JRE documentation for a list of <A
HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/intl/encoding.doc.html">supported
encodings</A>.
</LI>
<LI> The URL issues remaining in the 0.6 series have been
fixed in 0.7 by converting all SMB URL handling internally to use the
<tt>java.net.URL</tt> class (<i>Note: directories must now have a
trailing slash and Java 1.3 is required</i>). Also a deadlock in the
name service code was identified and fixed (repaired in 0.6.8 as well).
</LI>
<LI> A <tt>copyTo()</tt> method has
been added to <tt>SmbFile</tt> that is <A
HREF="http://lists.samba.org/pipermail/jcifs/2002-August/002357.html"><i>very
fast</i></A> at copying large directories across hosts.
</LI>
</UL>
There have been numerous other changes including the <tt>mkdirs()</tt>
and <tt>getType()</tt> methods, plain text password support (disabled
by default), the <tt>available()</tt> method and <tt>close()</tt>
fix for Named Pipes, reading files larger than 4 GB, the
<tt>NtlmAuthenticator</tt> class, and more.

<title>Java 1.3 Now Required</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, Wed Nov 12, 2002</sub>

Java 1.3 is now required with jcifs-0.7.0b4 or later. This is because
we are now using the Java 1.3 variant of <tt>java.net.URL.set()</tt> for

our requirements. Attempting to use Java 1.2 or below will result in an

<sub>posted by Mike, Tue Oct 22, 2002</sub>
<desc>
To resolve URL issues, jcifs now uses <tt>java.net.URL</tt> internally
throughout. This has changed the behavior of the client in very
significant ways and it will undoubtedly break older code. These
issues are:
<ul>
<li><b>URLs that represent workgroups, servers, shares, or directories
must have a trailing slash '/'.</b></li>
<li>Canonicalization does not exceed the host component of the
URL. So <tt>smb://host/share/path/</tt> + <tt>../../../../foo/</tt> is
canonicalized to <tt>smb://host/foo/</tt> whereas previously the client
would have reduced this to <tt>smb://foo/</tt>.</li>
<li>For constructors that accept a second parameter, that parameter can
no longer be <tt>null</tt>.</li>
<li>Composing a URL with a workgroup and a second parameter like
<tt>smb://workgroup/</tt> + <tt>server/share/path/</tt> used to
be intelligent enough to eliminate <tt>workgroup</tt>. This
will now blindly compose the two arguments to give
<tt>smb://workgroup/server/share/path/</tt> which is an illegal SMB URL.</li>
</ul>
See <a href="src/CHANGES.txt">CHANGES.txt</a> for a more detailed explanation.
<p/>
The <tt>NtlmHttpFilter</tt> and <tt>NetworkExplorer</tt> should
now work whereas before some users (largely Tomcat users) were
experiencing problems. The NTLM HTTP Authentication code is now
stateless and has been verified to work with both Resin and Tomcat
at least. An <tt>NtlmServlet</tt> has been contributed that can
negotiated NTLM SSP using older pre-2.3 servlet containers. Previously,
negotiated credentials could not be used to access SMB resources
with <tt>NetworkExplorer</tt>. This works now, and it is remarkably
fast, however you cannot filter <tt>NetworkExplorer</tt> with the
<tt>NtlmHttpFilter</tt>. The <a href="src/docs/ntlmhttpauth.html">NTLM
HTTP Authentication document</a> has been updated.

response is not properly terminated with <i>two</i> zeros like it
should be when Unicode is negotiated. I have patched jCIFS to only
look for one zero which should eliminate this problem.
<P/>
Unfortunately there are three other bugs that have not been attended
to as they all relate to the rather complicated issue of the SMB URL:
<ul>
<li>The URL protocol handler is not reentrant. It will produce
inconsistent results if <tt>java.net.URL</tt>s are created concurrently.</li>
<li>Full SMB URLs with an '@' in the path will misinterpret the
string following the '@' as the server component. This problem will
not occur if an <tt>SmbFile</tt> is composed with the two parameter
constructor or if user credentials are supplied.</li>
<li>There have been reports of a '/' being left out of SMB URLs being
created with the <tt>java.net.URL</tt> class. I have not been able to
reproduce this issue.</li>
</ul>
These issues will be resolved all together with a new simpler State

There's a nasty bug in Win2K that causes jCIFS to hang. The
<tt>PrimaryDomain</tt> field in the <tt>SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX</tt>

<P/>
Unfortunately there are three other bugs that have not been attended
to as they all relate to the rather complicated issue of the SMB URL:
<ul>
<li>The URL protocol handler is not reentrant. It will produce
inconsistent results if <tt>java.net.URL</tt>s are created concurrently.</li>
<li>Full SMB URLs with an '@' in the path will misinterpret the
string following the '@' as the server component. This problem will
not occur if an <tt>SmbFile</tt> is composed with the two parameter
constructor or if user credentials are supplied.</li>
<li>There have been reports of a '/' being left out of SMB URLs being
created with the <tt>java.net.URL</tt> class. I have not been able to
reproduce this issue.</li>
</ul>
These issues will be resolved all together with a new simpler State
Machine parser and properly integrated with the <tt>java.net.URL</tt>

<title>NTLM HTTP Authentication and the New <tt>jcifs.http</tt> Package</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, Wed Aug 8, 2002</sub>
<desc>
With the release of the 0.7.0 series, we are introducing a new
package; <tt>jcifs.http</tt>. The jCIFS client is proving to be quite
useful for adding functionality to websites on corporate intranets.
Adding a link to a document on your LAN for example is a trivial
exercise with jCIFS. In the <tt>jcifs.http</tt> package we will be
providing Servlets and CGIs that do this and more.
<P/>
To inaugurate this package, we have implemented NTLM HTTP
Authentication which allow MSIE clients to authenticate against a domain
controller. This is a useful feature because many of the tasks
surrounding user management now fall back to computer support and HR. It
is not necessary to add and remove users as they join and leave the
company. Perhaps most important from a user's perspective; they do not
need to enter a username or password if their workstation is a member of
the domain. The password hashes generated when they logged on to their
workstation will be negotiated during the initial request for a session,
passed through jCIFS, and validated against a PDC or BDC. This also
makes the users domain, username, and password available for managing
session information, profiles, preferences, etc.
<P/>
For complete details, please read <a href="src/docs/ntlmhttpauth.html">Authenticating MSIE Clients using NTLM HTTP Authentication and jCIFS</a>.
<P/>
We would be delighted to see popular application servers use the now
public <a href="src/docs/api/jcifs/smb/SmbSession.html">SmbSession</a>
class's <tt>getChallenge()</tt> and <tt>logon()</tt> methods to
integrate this functionality into their products in a way that is
consistent with other authentication schemes such as <tt>BASIC_AUTH</tt>
so that <tt>getRemoteUser()</tt> works expectedly or provide for NTLM
HTTP Authentication protected &#34;Relms&#34; in Tomcat.

New features:
<ul>
<li>NTLM HTTP Authentication.  Thanks to Jason Pugsley for his code and
bringing us up to speed on this. I know this will be a popular feature.
See above message for details.</li>
<li>A <tt>jcifs.smb.client.codepage</tt> property has been added to
specify an 8 bit character encoding to use for &#34;ASCII&#34; strings.
If your workgroup, server, and share names are not rendered properly you
may wish to explore this.  See <a href="src/CHANGES.txt">CHANGES.txt</a>

about using <tt>codepage=Cp866</tt> on his Russian LAN.  See the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/intl/encoding.doc.html">Supported
Encodings</a> page in the Sun JRE documentation for a list of valid
identifiers.</li>
<li>Added an <tt>SmbFile.getType()</tt> which will return one of the
following type identifiers:
<pre>
SmbFile.TYPE_WORKGROUP
SmbFile.TYPE_SERVER
SmbFile.TYPE_SHARE
SmbFile.TYPE_NAMED_PIPE
SmbFile.TYPE_PRINTER
SmbFile.TYPE_FILESYSTEM
</pre>
<TT>isWorkgroup()</TT> is now deprecated.</li>
<li>Added a "lookup" table to <tt>jcifs.netbios.NbtAddress</tt> like the
one in <tt>java.net.InetAddress</tt> to prevent redundant queries from
reaching the wire.</li>

<li>Plain text passwords have been implemented but must be enabled with
<tt>jcifs.smb.client.disablePlainTextPasswords=false</tt>.  This is
<tt>true</tt> by default and will generate a "Plain text passwords are
disabled" <tt>RuntimeException</tt> exception if you try to use it.</li>

<li>The <tt>SmbFile.length()</tt> method now returns the capacity of the
disk for a share. So <tt>getType()</tt> must be
<tt>SmbFile.TYPE_SHARE</tt>.</li>

<li>Added an <tt>SmbFile.freeDiskSpace()</tt> method that reports the
amount of free disk space in bytes on a disk exported by a share.</li>

<li>Added an <tt>SmbFile.copyTo()</tt> method. This method can copy
directories across hosts <i>very quickly</i> however at the moment it
does not mirror file attributes. See the end of <a
href="http://lists.samba.org/pipermail/jcifs/2002-August/002357.html">this
message</a> for details.</li>

<li>Replaced the <tt>AuthHandler</tt> interface and <tt>AuthInfo</tt>
with the abstract <tt>NtlmAuthenticator</tt> and
<tt>NtlmPasswordAuthentication</tt> classes to be consistent with the
<tt>Authenticator</tt> and <tt>PasswordAuthentication</tt> classes from

<title>jcifs-0.6.0 released</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, Wed Feb 20, 2002</sub>
<desc>
The jcifs-0.6.0 package is ready. The most significant improvement since 0.5 is performance.
<p/>
<b>Performance:</b>
<p/>
The performance improvements leading up to the 0.6 release have proven
to be significant. Raw transfer rates have not changed but listing
large directories, crawling over several hosts with multiple threads,
querying attributes on lists of files, and otherwise IO and multiplexing
intense operations have improved 800%+ in some cases. This release illustrates how a
carefully considered design can greatly improve the performance of an application. These
speed improvements are the result of reorganizing how buffers are used
(now only two per VM rather than per connection), elimination of
unnecessary network messages with smarter driver logic,
attribute caching, and analyzing spots where objects were being created
and destroyed frequently. This new client can crawl over every file
on my NT workstation in a hair over 10 seconds.
<p/>
Even though the focus for 0.6.0 was cleanup, refactoring, and
performance, there are a few new features worth mentioning. Here's
a breakdown.
<p/>
<b>New Features:</b>

<ul>
<li>The <code>listFiles</code> methods have been added which offer
a significant speed boost for operations that intensively query the
attributes of each file in the list.</li>
<li>Many of the <a href="src/docs/api/jcifs/smb/SmbFile.html"><code>SmbFile</code></a>
methods throw the now public
<a href="src/docs/api/jcifs/smb/SmbException.html"><code>SmbException</code></a>.</li>
<li>An <a href="src/docs/api/jcifs/util/AuthHandler.html"><code>AuthHandler</code></a>
interface and
<a href="src/docs/api/jcifs/smb/SmbAuthException.html"><code>SmbAuthException</code></a>
have been introduced for handling authentication related error
conditions.</li>
<li>The name service code has been generalized to handle
both DNS and NetBIOS name services much more smoothly
(0.5 handles this incorrectly actually) using the new
<a href="src/docs/api/jcifs/UniAddress.html"><code>UniAddress</code></a>.</li>
<li>The client can now list the hosts of a workgroup/ntdomain on remote
networks; you can enumerate an entire WAN.</li>
<li>The client is a lot smarter about how to ultimately service requests.</li>
<li>Graceful reconnect.</li>
<li>Support for Novell NetWare.</li>

<title>Updated SMB URL Internet Draft</title>

The <A HREF="http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-crhertel-smb-url-02.txt">SMB
URL Internet Draft</A> has been updated.  The new draft includes support
for the <TT>:port</TT> field, and the use of query strings to specify
NBT context (WINS server, Called Name, etc.)  The document provides a
fixed set of keywords that may be used within the query section of the
URL string.  It would be nice to have a third-party authority placed in
charge of accepting updates to the keyword list.  Unfortunately, the
keywords <I>must</I> be interpreted by the client rather than the
server, so adding new keywords without some sort of public comment
process would cause some clients to break.
<P/>
The new draft does <I>not</I> include any support for SMB over native
TCP (port 445 semantics).  This is still an area for discussion.  While
it is clear that adding support for non-NBT file services would be easy,
no one yet (including myself) has provided a mechanism for efficiently
browsing services within a W2K Domain via the SMB URL.  This may turn

If a DNS name longer than 15 characters is used with a

<code>WINS</code> or <code>BCAST</code> (the default of
<code>resolveOrder=LMHOSTS,WINS,BCAST,DNS</code> qualifies) the

the name query will fail and jCIFS will not be able to connect to
the host. The only solution at the moment is to use <code>DNS</code>
before <code>WINS</code> and <code>BCAST</code> or do not use both
types of resolution simultaniously.
<P/>
This has prompted a bit of refactoring, reducing, rewriting, general
cleanup, comments ... etc (everywhere, not just in the above mentioned
resolver code). The result will be 0.6. This means no new features

I met up with the Australian contingent of the Samba Team on Sunday,
the day before the PlugFest started.  We all went out to the hotel pool
on what proved to be the only warm and sunny day of the week.  The plan
was to relax and spend some time swimming, but Tridge got the idea of
setting up a Wireless Access Point so we could all sit by the pool with
our laptops.  I think we spent five hours trying to get the modem in the
Apple Airport to dial out and authenticate properly.  We never did get
it working (and I never got into that pool).  Eventually, we used
Tridge's Linux Laptop to dial in, hard-wired that to the Airport, and
used the Airport's DHCP service to hand out unrouted IPs.  It was a bit
of a hack but it worked.
<P/>
The PlugFest started Monday.  Many CIFS vendors were present,
including some new faces, and I was able to test jCIFS against a large
variety of servers.  Some jCIFS bugs were discovered (and squashed) and
I was also able to demonstrate the utility of jCIFS as a test client.
The ease with which new torture tests can be written makes jCIFS an
excellent tool for server verification.
<P/>
A number of issues were discussed at the Conference, including the
current status of the <A HREF="http://www.snia.org/English/Work_Groups/NAS/CIFS/WG_CIFS_Docs.html">SNIA
CIFS document</A> which has been downgraded from a Specification to a
Technical Reference.  The <A HREF="http://www.snia.org">SNIA</A> is also
looking for CIFS compatibility testing tools to help CIFS implementors
verify their products, so (as time permits...and it typically doesn't) I
will be looking at writing and documenting some more formal jCIFS test
suites.

No new features. Just many sorely needed bug fixes. The jcifs-0.5dev2
release has some pretty serious problems. This release should be

have also writtin a crude <a

<title>Bug in jcifs-0.4 SmbFile.list() Method</title>
<sub>posted by Mike, Fri May 11, 2001</sub>
<desc>
There is a serious bug in NT and NT Server that can
cause the <code>SmbFile.list()</code> method to get
caught in an endless loop consuming major cpu cycles
and bandwidth. The problem is described in more detail <a
href="http://lists.samba.org/pipermail/jcifs/2001-March/001095.html">here</a>.
<P/>
There is no fix except to not call <code>SmbFile.list()</code>. Do not
use jcifs-0.4 in a production environment if your application uses this
method. The bug has been properly fixed in jcifs-0.5dev1, however this
version is highly experimental and has known bugs of it's own.  We are
sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.

We now embark on the first experimental series of
what will become jcifs-0.5. New features include the
Transactions API, batching, and workgroup, server,
share enumeration. Tunable batching, which is described <a
href="http://auditorymodels.org/jcifs/src/docs/batching.html">here</a>,
should only be of interest to CIFS developers. What should
intrest most people is that jCIFS now has the ability to enumerate
workgroups of a network, servers of a workgroup, and shares of a
server with <code>smb://</code>, <code>smb://workgroup</code>,
and <code>smb://server</code> URLs respectively. For example
the url <code>smb://storage15</code> will list the shares
available on the server <code>storage15</code>. This makes <a
href="http://auditorymodels.org/jcifs/src/examples/SmbShell.java">SmbShell</a>
start to look pretty slick because you can <code>cd</code> all around
your network.

The jcifs client is now stable and ready for use. This is not
"infrastructure" anymore. It _should_ work flawlessly. I got
rid of quiet a bit of fat such as that "Demultiplexer" thing I
preached for two months :~) I took Chris' advice and created our
own normalized abstraction based on the java.io.File class for
the API. There's no XFile accessor but the URL protocol handler
is in place. This is NOT alpha code and it will only be beta
until I get some confirmation that it works for everybody. If you
have any problems get on the mailing list. Eveything's in the <a
